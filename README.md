# LLVM Projects

## Introduction
These LLVM projects are part of Advanced Compiler course. There are four part (project) in total, from very simple static, dynamic instructions counting to ... .

## Directory Hierarchy
All pass source codes of each part ar in the 'Passes' directory. 'Part1,2,3,4' are subdirectories of each part.

## Part 1
Part1 has three sections:
1.  counting number of static instructions in functions
2.  counting number of dynamic instructions in functions
3.  obtain the runtime branch bias information in functions
