# LLVM Projects

## Introduction
These LLVM projects are part of Advanced Compiler course. There are four parts (projects) in total, from very simple static, dynamic instructions counting to reaching definition analysis, and ...

## Part 1
Part1 has three sections:
1.  counting number of static instructions in functions
2.  counting number of dynamic instructions in functions
3.  obtain the runtime branch bias information in functions
